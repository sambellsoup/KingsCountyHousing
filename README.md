Examining Housing Price Trends in Kings County / Predicting Development

My goal is to examine longitudinal housing sales and tax data in Kings County in order to predict areas that are most at risk of gentrification and people who are most at risk of displacement. 

I will begin by collecting building data in Kings County. I am searching specifically for sales price of buildings and tax evaluations on buildings. 

I want to organize the data mainly by year and track the moving trends of the top 10% and bottom 10% of housing prices. I may alter these parameters upon closer inspection of my data.
